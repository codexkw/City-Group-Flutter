## Bug Tracker

| ID | Screen | Description | Status |
|----|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | api_client.dart | `prefer_const_constructors` info warnings | Low priority |
| 2 | check_in/out | `use_build_context_synchronously` info warnings | Low priority |

---

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Riverpod for state (not Bloc/Provider) | Consistent with pubspec.yaml setup |
| Pause reason cannot be dismissed | PRD requirement — mandatory server-side too |
| Speed logs buffered in SQLite | Offline-first — network not always available in field |
| JWT in flutter_secure_storage | More secure than SharedPreferences |
| RTL via Directionality widget in main.dart | Single control point for entire app |
| geolocator 11.x uses `desiredAccuracy` param | Not `locationSettings` — API changed in v11 |
